# Goldbachs Conjecture 
The Goldbach conjecture was conjectured by Christian Goldbach in 1742.  
It states that any even number can be the sum of any 2 prime numbers, however it is  
still unproven. Source > https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach's_conjecture  
This program tests Goldbach's conjecture up to a given number.  
Do `python3 gbc.py` to run, then enter a number. The program will test the  
conjecture on all even numbers up to the provided number.  

## C++ Version:
I wanted to make a version of this program in C++ for speed's sake... 
unfortunatly the C++ version is slower than the Python version. This is due 
to my sloppy C++ code, and faliure to optimize functions. Will attempt to optimize.
